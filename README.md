# 🧠 NMT Interface Enhancer


Welcome! This is a little Chrome Extension to make the NMT reporting site much easier and nicer to use. 

It adds:

- 🚀 **Quick Navigation**: Jump between Part A, B, C, and D instantly with a sidebar.
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: See exactly how much you've done with a progress bar and filling buttons.
- 🐦 **Daily Bird**: A consistent, calming bird background specific to each report.
